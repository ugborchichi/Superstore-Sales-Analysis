# Superstore Sales Analysis (SQL and Excel dashboard)

## Project Overview

The Superstore KPI Dashboard was designed to provide leadership with a centralized, data-driven view of business performance across critical retail metrics, including Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount.

Superstore operates nationwide across three core product categories—Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture—with a diverse portfolio of products and a large customer base. As the business scaled, management required an interactive dashboard to consolidate performance tracking and support faster, more informed decision-making.

The dashboard delivers:

-	A clear, at-a-glance view of overall performance

-	Detailed analysis by product category, sub-category, and customer segment

-	Visibility into customer-level contribution and profitability

-	YoY and MoM comparisons between current and prior periods

By transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, the dashboard enables executives and managers to identify growth opportunities, address performance gaps, and prioritize strategic initiatives effectively.
